About
===

10K is a mod WIP mod by MisterFiber that's currently being hosted on GitHub prior to release. It adds a dimension to Minecraft called 10K. In the mods early phases in development, I don't feel mentally comfortable giving away too much ideas or aspirations for this mod, in the case that it either doesn't live up to expectations, or I just plaing don't finish it.
