10K
===

The "rework" branch is for the process of converting 10K to a dimension rather than a world type... The generational restrictions I enforced with 10K as a world type backfired and instead of adding challenge and enjoyment, it added lack of content and boredom.

Also, I wanted to add a lot more aesthetic and gameplay changes to 10K, and the existing code for world types just won't let me do what I want to.

This mod is not final in the slightest. All is subject to change.

Do not use the master branch with Minecraft 1.4.2. It's 1.3.2 compatibile.
