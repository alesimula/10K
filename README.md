About
===

10K is a WIP mod by MisterFiber that's currently being hosted on GitHub prior to release. It adds a dimension to Minecraft called 10K. In the mod's early phases of development, I don't feel mentally comfortable giving away too much ideas or aspirations, in the case that it either doesn't live up to expectations, or I just plain don't finish it.

10K currently runs on Forge build 6.4.0.394 and Minecraft version 1.4.5.
Code contribution (technical only, please) is always welcome.

Feel free to fork and send a pull request if it fixes an error/syntax issue/poor coding/whatever I may have done.
